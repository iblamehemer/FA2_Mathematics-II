# Dataset configuration for PPE detection.
#
# This YAML file follows the format expected by Ultralytics YOLOv8.
# You must update the `train`, `val` and `test` paths to point to the
# appropriate directories on your system.  Each of these directories
# should contain an `images/` folder with the images and a `labels/`
# folder with YOLO‑formatted label files.

train: /Users/hp/Downloads/ppe_app_streamlit/datasets/train/images
val:   /Users/hp/Downloads/ppe_app_streamlit/datasets/valid/images
test:  /Users/hp/Downloads/ppe_app_streamlit/datasets/test/images


# Number of classes
nc: 5

# Class names.  The order here must match the class IDs in the labels.
names: ['boots', 'gloves', 'helmet', 'human', 'vest']
